## Internet of Water Github

This is the GitHub page for the Internet of Water project at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University. We make a variety of tools to facilitate the opening of water data in United States to lower data-related barriers to sound water policy-making. Tools being developed in this space include:

1. Glossary: An ontology of water science, data, and policy-related concepts.
2. Water Budgeting Framework: An ontology of water budgeting components, estimation methods and models, model parameters, and data sources required to build water budgets.

## Glossary

The glossary is managed with WebProtégé <https://protege.stanford.edu/> in an ontology that assigns URIs to unique concepts corresponding to unique definitions. So, terms with conflicting definitions by different organizations are encoded as unique concepts that have a semantic relationship to the same term, which is a unique concept on its own.

The current glossary can be browsed at purl.org/iow/glossary (currently nonfunctional)

The underlying ontology is storead at internetofwater.github.io/Glossary/glossary.ttl


## Water Budgeting Framework

The water budgeting framework is an ontology of 5 major concepts:
1. Water Budgeting Framework Developer: Entities that have developed and published frameworks to estimate water budgets. So far, included developers include the USGS, California Department of Water Resources, and Utah Department of Water Resources.
